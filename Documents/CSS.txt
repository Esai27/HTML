CSS - Cascading Style Sheet

To add styles to HTML.
Styling ---> Adding colors, Fonts, Size, Borders, etc.

CSS is not a programming Language. It's not a markup language either.

CSS is a Style Sheet Language. CSS is a rule-based language.

How to define Style for HTML Elements:
1.In line
<h1 style = "color:red"> Haiii </h1>

2.By using Style Tag:
<html>
<head>
<style type="text/css">
h1{
 color:blue;
  }
</style>
</head>
  
not recommended Because this needs to be repeated for every HTML file

Separate CSS File:

style.css
==========
h1{color:red}

index.html:
===========
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style1.css">
</head>

<h1>Welcome to our CSS class </h1>
 

Basic Structure of CSS file:
=============================
tagname{
      property:value;
       }
eg:
h1{
  color:red;
  }

Selector:
#p ---> selecting id,==ID Selector
.p ---> selecting class == Class Selector
h1,h2 ---> Headings == Attribute Selector
*     ----> Apply to all == Universal Selector


More than one class
attributename.classname{color:blue;}
eg: p.class{color:blue}

we mentioned link in html including target attribute, here we add
some styles, How we select the target attribute?

a[target] --> we mentioned square bracket[] here.
[title~=linux]==> In this command tells wherever we have 
title having linux word that element applied the styles

[class|=top]--> it defines the class name as exact top or else
top word in separate
Eg:
top, top - field, top - letter ----> Applicable
topstory, topcirclr ----> not applicable

[class^="abc"]==> which class starts with "abc" the style 
applicable for those classes
it checks the starting attr in regex


[class$="xyz"] which are the classes ending with "xyz" the style 
applicable for all those classes
it checks the ending of the class name

[class*="xy"] which of the class name have the "xy", style 
applicable for all those classes
it checks if the class having the specified letters

div p{
  color:green;
   } ====> It applies for the P tag inside the division element

div > p{} ==> It applies which p tag follows the immediate
children of div
